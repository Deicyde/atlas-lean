# Consecutive vertices of the contracted path are joined by arcs

**Consecutive vertices of the contracted path are joined by arcs.** Let $\varphi$ be a CNF
formula with $m$ clauses and $k$ distinct variables. In Sipser's HAMPATH graph for $\varphi$, clause
$j$ is vertex $j < m$, the top of diamond $i$ is $t_i = m + i(3m + 2)$, and vertex $l \le 3m$ of
its row is $r_{i,l} = t_i + 1 + l$. Let $p$ be a Hamiltonian path of this graph (on the vertices
$0, \dots, t_k$) from $t_0$ to $t_k$ whose detours are normal: for every $j < m$ there is $i < k$
such that $j$ sits in $p$ immediately between $r_{i,3j+1}$ and $r_{i,3j+2}$, in either order. Let
$p'$ be $p$ with the clause vertices deleted. If $v$ comes right after $u$ in $p'$, then
$(u, v)$ is an arc of the graph, $u \ge m$ and $v \ge m$.
