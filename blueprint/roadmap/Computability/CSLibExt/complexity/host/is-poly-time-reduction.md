# Reduction host, canonical form

**Reduction host, canonical form.** Let $c$ be a component machine with stacks $c_X$ and
$c_O$ and labels $\mathit{start}$ and $\mathit{done}$, where the statement at $\mathit{done}$ is
the halting statement. Let $g_X$ map bits to symbols of $c_X$, let $e_O$ be a bijection from the
alphabet of $c_O$ to the booleans, let $f$ map bit lists to bit lists, and let $p$ be a polynomial
with coefficients in $\mathbb{N}$. Suppose that for every bit list $x$, the component started at
$\mathit{start}$ with internal state false, with $g_X$ applied to each bit of $x$ on $c_X$ and
every other stack empty, reaches the label $\mathit{done}$ in at most $p(|x|)$ steps with stack
$c_O$ holding exactly $e_O^{-1}$ applied to each bit of $f(x)$. Then $f$ is polynomial-time
computable for the canonical bitstring encodings.
