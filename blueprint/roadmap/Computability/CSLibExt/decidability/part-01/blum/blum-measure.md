# Blum complexity measure

**Blum complexity measure.** A Blum measure $\Phi$ assigns to every program $c$ and input
$n \in \mathbb{N}$ a partially defined cost $\Phi_c(n) \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfying Blum's two axioms:
$\Phi_c(n)$ is defined exactly when program $c$ halts on input $n$, and the relation
$\Phi_c(n) = m$ between $c$, $n$ and $m$ is decidable.
