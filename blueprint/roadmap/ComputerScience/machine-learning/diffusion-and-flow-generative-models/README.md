# Diffusion and flow-based generative models

Linear algebra of diffusion and flow-based generative models: for Gaussian data, the score and the optimal denoiser are spectral functions of the data covariance and the probability-flow ODE is a linear system with commuting coefficients whose flow map is an explicit affine map; for any differentiable velocity field, the divergence in the log-density computations of flow models is the trace of a Jacobian. These pages are AI-authored expositions of published results without Lean formalization; each names what it relies on, and how, under Informally uses, and marks results not stated in its sources as derived.
