# Concentration of the uniform deviation

Let $z_1, \dots, z_n$, with $n \ge 1$, be independent and identically distributed examples, let
$\mathcal{F}$ be a nonempty class of predictors and let the loss $\ell$ take values in
$[0, \ell_\infty]$ for some $\ell_\infty > 0$, with the map $z = (x, y) \mapsto \ell(y, f(x))$
measurable for each $f \in \mathcal{F}$. With $R$ and $\hat R$ the expected and empirical risks, consider the
uniform deviation

$$
H(z_1, \dots, z_n) = \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \big(R(f) - \hat R(f)\big),
$$

and assume that $H$ is measurable, as it is when $\mathcal{F}$ is countable, since each
$R(f) - \hat R(f)$ is then measurable. Then for every
$\delta \in (0, 1]$, with probability at least $1 - \delta$,

$$
H \le \mathbb{E}[H] + \ell_\infty \sqrt{\frac{\log(1 / \delta)}{2n}}.
$$

Derivation: replacing one example $z_i$ by another changes each $\hat R(f)$ by at most
$\ell_\infty / n$, so it changes $R(f) - \hat R(f)$ by at most $\ell_\infty / n$ for every $f$,
and hence changes the supremum $H$ by at most $\ell_\infty / n$. $H$ takes values in
$[-\ell_\infty, \ell_\infty]$. McDiarmid's bounded-differences inequality with every constant
equal to $\ell_\infty / n$ gives $\mathbb{P}(H - \mathbb{E}[H] \ge t) \le
\exp(-2 n t^2 / \ell_\infty^2)$ for $t > 0$; taking
$t = \ell_\infty \sqrt{\log(1/\delta) / (2n)}$ and passing to the complementary event gives the
bound (for $\delta = 1$ it is trivial). The same argument applies to
$\sup_{f} (\hat R(f) - R(f))$, and a union bound over the two events replaces $\log(1/\delta)$ by
$\log(2/\delta)$ when both deviations are bounded at once. The source writes these bounds with
probability greater than $1 - \delta$ for $\delta \in (0, 1)$, with the loss bounded on the
support of the data; the form above, with probability at least $1 - \delta$ for
$\delta \in (0, 1]$, is derived.

This reduces a high-probability bound on the uniform deviation to a bound on its expectation, which
is controlled separately, for example by symmetrization with Rademacher complexities in the source;
this page does not cover that step.

Only a restricted case matches a statement formalized in this library: examples taking finitely many
values, with the one-sided upper tail. In that case the bound above is the library's finite i.i.d.
McDiarmid inequality with $c_i = \ell_\infty / n$, so that $\sum_i c_i^2 = \ell_\infty^2 / n$.
For examples in a general measurable space, the step is the classical inequality, which this library
does not formalize.

This page is an AI-authored exposition; it has no Lean formalization in this library.
