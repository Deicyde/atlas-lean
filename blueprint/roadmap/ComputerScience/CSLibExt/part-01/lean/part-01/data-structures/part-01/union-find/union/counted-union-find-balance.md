# The FIND phases of a union make two more root tests than parent writes

**The FIND phases of a union make two more root tests than parent writes.** For a
union-find structure $S$ and indices $x, y$ of $S$, in the counted union of $x$ and $y$ in $S$ the
total number of root tests made by its two FIND calls equals the total number of parent writes
they make plus $2$.

## Depends on

- [Union by rank with operation counts](counted-union.md)

## Proof depends on

- [Root tests exceed parent writes by one](../find/counted-aux-time-balance.md)
- [Cost-counted FIND](../find/counted-find.md)
