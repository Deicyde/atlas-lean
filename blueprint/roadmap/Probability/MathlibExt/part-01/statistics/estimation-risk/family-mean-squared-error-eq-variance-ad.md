# Bias–variance decomposition for a parametric family

**Bias–variance decomposition for a parametric family.** Let $S$ be a measurable space,
$W : S \to \mathbb{R}$ an estimator, $(P_\theta)_{\theta \in \Theta}$ a family of probability
measures on $S$ and $\tau : \Theta \to \mathbb{R}$ a target function. Suppose that for every
$\theta \in \Theta$, $W$ has a finite second moment under $P_\theta$, and $W$ and
$(W - \tau(\theta))^2$ are integrable for $P_\theta$. Then for every $\theta \in \Theta$ the family
mean squared error of $W$ at $\theta$ equals the variance $\operatorname{Var}_{P_\theta}(W)$ of
$W$ under $P_\theta$ plus the square of the family bias of $W$ at $\theta$.
