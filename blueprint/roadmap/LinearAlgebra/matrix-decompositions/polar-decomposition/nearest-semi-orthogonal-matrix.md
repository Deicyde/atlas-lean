# Nearest semi-orthogonal matrices

Let $G$ be a real $m \times n$ matrix, let $k = \min(m, n)$, let $r = \operatorname{rank} G$, and
let $\sigma_1 \ge \dots \ge \sigma_k \ge 0$ be its singular values. Write
$\langle A, B \rangle = \operatorname{tr}(A^{\mathsf{T}} B)$ and call an $m \times n$ matrix $A$
semi-orthogonal if $A A^{\mathsf{T}} = I_m$ or $A^{\mathsf{T}} A = I_n$. Let
$P(G) = U_r V_r^{\mathsf{T}}$ be the canonical polar factor, built from a compact singular value
decomposition $G = U_r \Sigma_r V_r^{\mathsf{T}}$ ($P(0) = 0$). Then:

1. For every semi-orthogonal $A$,
   $\|A - G\|_F^2 = k - 2 \langle A, G \rangle + \|G\|_F^2$ and
   $\langle A, G \rangle \le \sigma_1 + \dots + \sigma_k$.
2. Hence, for every thin singular value decomposition $G = \sum_{i \le k} \sigma_i u_i v_i^{\mathsf{T}}$,
   the matrix $\sum_{i \le k} u_i v_i^{\mathsf{T}}$ is a semi-orthogonal matrix nearest to $G$ in
   Frobenius norm.
3. The nearest semi-orthogonal matrix is unique if and only if $r = k$, and then it equals $P(G)$.
4. If $r < k$, it is not unique: changing the signs of the $v_i$ with $\sigma_i = 0$ in a thin
   decomposition gives a second one.

Remark (derived here, not stated in the cited paper): the nearest semi-orthogonal matrices are
exactly the matrices $P(G) + \tilde U Q \tilde V^{\mathsf{T}}$, where the columns of $\tilde U$ and
$\tilde V$ are orthonormal bases of the orthogonal complement of the column space of $G$ and of the
kernel of $G$, and $Q$ is any semi-orthogonal $(m - r) \times (n - r)$ matrix. When $r = k$, one of
$m - r$ and $n - r$ is $0$, $Q$ is empty and the set is $\{P(G)\}$.

Proof: a semi-orthogonal $A$ has $\|A\|_F^2 = \operatorname{tr}(A^{\mathsf{T}} A) = k$, which gives
the identity; it also has spectral norm $1$, so the duality of the spectral and nuclear norms gives
$\langle A, G \rangle = \sum_{i \le r} \sigma_i u_i^{\mathsf{T}} A v_i \le \sum_i \sigma_i$. The thin
product of item 2 is semi-orthogonal and attains the bound. Equality forces
$u_i^{\mathsf{T}} A v_i = 1$, so $A v_i = u_i$ and $A^{\mathsf{T}} u_i = v_i$, for every $i \le r$.
If $r = n \le m$, this fixes $A$ on all of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and if $r = m \le n$, it fixes
$A^{\mathsf{T}}$ on all of $\mathbb{R}^m$; either way $A = P(G)$. If $r < k$, the sign change of
item 4 gives a different semi-orthogonal matrix with the same inner product.
