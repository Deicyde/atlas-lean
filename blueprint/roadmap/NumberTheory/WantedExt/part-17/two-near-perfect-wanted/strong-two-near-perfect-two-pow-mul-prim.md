# Strongly $2$-near perfect numbers of the form $2^k p$

**Strongly $2$-near perfect numbers of the form $2^k p$.** Let $p$ be an odd prime, let $k$
be a natural number and let $n = 2^k p$. Suppose that $n$ is strongly $2$-near perfect, that is,
$\sigma(n) = 2n + d + n/d$ for some divisor $d$ of $n$, where $\sigma$ is the sum-of-divisors
function. Then there is a natural number $a \le k$ with $p(1 + 2^{k-a}) = 2^{k+1} - 2^a - 1$,
that is, $p = (2^{k+1} - 2^a - 1)/(1 + 2^{k-a})$.
