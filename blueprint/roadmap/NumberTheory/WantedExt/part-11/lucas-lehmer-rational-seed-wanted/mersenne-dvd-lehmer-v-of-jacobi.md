# Divisibility of Lehmer's companion sequence by a Mersenne prime

**Divisibility of Lehmer's companion sequence by a Mersenne prime.** Let $n \ge 3$ be an odd
natural number such that $M_n = 2^n - 1$ is prime, let $R$ and $Q$ be integers, let
$\bar V_k(R, Q)$ denote Lehmer's companion sequence, and put $D = R - 4Q$. If the Jacobi symbols
$\left(\frac{DR}{M_n}\right)$ and $\left(\frac{QR}{M_n}\right)$ are both $-1$, then $M_n$
divides $\bar V_{(M_n+1)/2}(R, Q) = \bar V_{2^{n-1}}(R, Q)$.

Since $M_n$ is prime, these Jacobi symbols are Legendre symbols.
