# Meromorphic continuation of the ℓ-generalized Fibonacci zeta function

**Meromorphic continuation of the ℓ-generalized Fibonacci zeta function.** Let $\ell \ge 2$,
let $F$ be an $\ell$-generalized Fibonacci sequence, let $\alpha > 1$ be a real number with
$\alpha^\ell = \sum_{i=0}^{\ell-1} \alpha^i$, and let $S$ be the set of possible poles determined
by $\ell$ and $\alpha$. Then there is a function $f : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ such that
$f(s) = \sum_{n \ge 1} F(n)^{-s}$ for every complex $s$ with $\operatorname{Re} s > 0$, $f$ is
complex differentiable at every point outside $S$, and for every $s_0 \in S$ the limit of
$(s - s_0) f(s)$ as $s \to s_0$ with $s \ne s_0$ exists in $\mathbb{C}$.

The last clause says that $f$ has at most simple poles, all lying in $S$; the residues are
stated separately.
