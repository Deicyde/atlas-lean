# Euclid moves

**Euclid moves.** The moves of Euclid from a pair $(a, b)$ of natural numbers are as follows.
If $a = b$, $a = 0$ or $b = 0$, there are none. If $0 < a < b$, the moves are to the pairs
$(a, b - ja)$ for every integer $j \ge 1$ with $ja < b$; if $0 < b < a$, the moves are to the
pairs $(a - jb, b)$ for every integer $j \ge 1$ with $jb < a$.
