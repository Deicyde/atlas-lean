# Aunt or cousin of a P-position

**Aunt or cousin of a P-position.** Call a pair $(a, b)$ of natural numbers a P-position when
the Euclid P-position test returns true at $(a, b)$, and let its son be $s(a, b) = (a, a + b)$ and
its daughter $d(a, b) = (a + b, b)$, as in the Calkin–Wilf tree. Let $x, y$ be positive integers,
let $r = (x, y)$, let $q$ be one of the two children $s(r)$ and $d(r)$ of $r$, and let $q'$ be the
other one. If the daughter $d(q)$ is a P-position, then exactly one of its aunt $q'$ and its male
cousin $s(q')$ is a P-position. If the son $s(q)$ is a P-position, then exactly one of its uncle
$q'$ and its female cousin $d(q')$ is a P-position.
