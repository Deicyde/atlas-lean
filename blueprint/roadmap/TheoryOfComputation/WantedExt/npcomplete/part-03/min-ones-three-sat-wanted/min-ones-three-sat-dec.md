# The MINIMUM ONES 3-SAT decision problem

**The MINIMUM ONES 3-SAT decision problem.** MINIMUM ONES 3-SAT is the decision problem that
accepts a bitstring $x$ exactly when $x$ decodes, under the canonical bitstring encoding, to a
triple $(n, \varphi, K)$ of a natural number $n$, a CNF formula $\varphi$ and a natural number $K$
such that every clause of $\varphi$ is a list of exactly three literals whose variables are all
less than $n$, and some assignment of truth values to the variables $0, \dots, n-1$ satisfies
$\varphi$ and sets at most $K$ of them to true. Every other bitstring is rejected.
