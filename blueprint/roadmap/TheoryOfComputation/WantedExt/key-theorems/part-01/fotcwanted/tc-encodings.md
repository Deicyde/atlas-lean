# Encodings of a class of ordered graphs

**Encodings of a class of ordered graphs.** For a set $K$ of ordered graphs, this is the
decision problem that accepts a bitstring $x$ exactly when $x$ decodes, under the canonical
bitstring encoding of pairs of a natural number and a list of booleans, to some ordered graph
$(n, T) \in K$ whose edge table $T$ has length exactly $n^2$.
