# No integer points for coprime denominators, the first at least 3

**No integer points for coprime denominators, the first at least 3.** Let
$s_1, s_2, p_1, p_2, q_1, q_2$ be natural numbers with $\gcd(p_1, q_1) = 1$, $\gcd(q_1, q_2) = 1$
and $q_1 \ge 3$, and let $x = s_1 + p_1/q_1$ and $d = s_2 + p_2/q_2$. Then for all natural numbers
$i$ and $j$, neither $x + id$ nor $2x + jd$ is a nonnegative integer.

The paper's further hypotheses ($p_1, p_2, q_2 > 0$, $\gcd(p_2, q_2) = 1$, $d \notin \mathbb{N}$)
are not needed and are not stated ($p_1 > 0$ and $q_2 > 0$ already follow from the two coprimality
conditions and $q_1 \ge 3$).
