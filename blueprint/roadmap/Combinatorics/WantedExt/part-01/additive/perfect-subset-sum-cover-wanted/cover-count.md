# Cover count

**Cover count.** Let $G$ be an abelian group, $s = (s_i)_{i \in \iota}$ a family in $G$
indexed by a finite type $\iota$ (a colored multiset), and $g \in G$. The cover count of $g$ by
$s$ is the number of index sets $I \subseteq \iota$ with $\sum_{i \in I} s_i = g$: the number of
times $s$ covers $g$ by its subset sums (the empty set covers $0$).
