# The last gap of size one between unsums

**The last gap of size one between unsums.** Let $a_1 < a_2 < \cdots$ be the unsums
(OEIS A260317), and for $i \ge 0$ let $g_i = a_{i+2} - a_{i+1}$ be the $i$-th gap between
consecutive unsums, counted from zero. Then $g_9 = 1$, and $g_i \ne 1$ for every $i \ge 10$.
