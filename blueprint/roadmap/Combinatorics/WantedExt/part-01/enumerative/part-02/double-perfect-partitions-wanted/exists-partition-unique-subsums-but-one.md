# Partitions with unique subsums except one

**Partitions with unique subsums except one.** The partitions of $m$ contained in a
partition $\lambda$ are the distinct sub-multisets of the parts of $\lambda$ with sum $m$. Let
$v \ge 1$. There are a natural number $n$ and a partition $\lambda$ of $n$ that contains exactly
$v$ partitions of some $m$ with $v \le m \le n - v$ and exactly one partition of every positive
integer $m' < n$ other than $m$ if and only if $v = 1$ or $v = 2$.

The hypothesis $v \ge 1$ is needed: for $v = 0$ the partition $(2)$ of $2$ qualifies with
$m = 1$, since it contains no partition of $1$.
