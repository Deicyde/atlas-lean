# Generating function of the total subword count in non-decreasing Dyck paths

**Generating function of the total subword count in non-decreasing Dyck paths.** For a word
$w$ in the steps $U$ and $D$, let $d_w(n)$ be the total number of occurrences of $w$ as a
contiguous subword (overlapping occurrences counted separately) over all non-decreasing Dyck
paths of semilength $n$. The univariate generating function of $w$ is the integer power series

$$D_w(x) = \sum_{n \ge 0} d_w(n) x^n.$$
