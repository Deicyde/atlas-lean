# Augmentation of a $k$-Dyck word

**Augmentation of a $k$-Dyck word.** Let $k \ge 0$ and let $w$ be a word in the letters
$U = (1,1)$ and $D^{(k)} = (k,-k)$, for example a $k$-Dyck path. The augmented path of $w$ is the
word in the skew Dyck steps $U$, $D$, $L$ obtained from $w$ by keeping each letter $U$ and
replacing each letter $D^{(k)}$ by $U D^{k-1} L D$, where $D^{k-1}$ means $k - 1$ copies of $D$
(none when $k \le 1$).
